    Friends Episode 3 Season 1: The one with the thumb.

Phoebe: Hi guys!
All: Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Ross: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Phoebe: Um, not so good.
Phoebe: He walked me to the subway and said “We should do this again!'”
All: Oh. Ouch.
Rachel: What? He said “we should do it again”, that's good, right?
Monica: Uh, no. Loosely translated “We should do this again” means “You will never see me naked”.
Rachel: Since when?
Joey: Since always. It's like dating language. You know, like “It's not you'” means “It is you”.
Chandler: Or “You're such a nice guy” means I'm gonna be dating leather wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you."
Phoebe: Or, or, you know, um, “I think we should see other people” means “Ha, ha, I already am”.
Rachel: And everybody knows this?
Joey: Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Chandler: Yes, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Ross: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Monica: Uh, Ross.
Ross: What? Wh hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was it w.....
Ross: Oh, my God! ChiChi!
Chandler: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"
Joey: "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Chandler: Hey, that was really good!
Joey: Yeah?
Joey: Thanks! Let's keep going.
Chandler: Okay. "So. What do you want from me, Damone, huh?"
Joey: "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
Chandler: "Smoke away."
Chandler: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Joey: What?
Chandler: Relax your hand. Let your wrist go.
Chandler: Not so much!
Joey: Whoah!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Alright, now try taking a puff.
Chandler: Alright...okay. No. Give it to me.
Joey: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Chandler: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. Alright, Now, Don't think of it as a cigarette.
Chandler: Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand.
Chandler: When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Joey: You miss it?
Chandler: Nah, not so much.
Chandler: Alright, now we smoke. Oh...my...God.
Joey: Chandler give me that!
Chandler: No no no. You've got options. You can smoke like this.
Joey: Chandler!
Chandler: Or you can hold it in your mouth and smoke like this.
Joey: Chandler give me the cigarette! Give me, give me.
Chandler: uh, you try it.
Joey: thank you.
Joey: Okay, how's this?
Chandler: Okay, that's not bad.
Chandler: All right, now when you are finished, It's really cool if you flick it. You kinda flick it. You flick it...
Chandler: That's good, all right, you keep practicing...and I will go put out the sofa.
Chandler: I thought it had to do with the size of the guy's feet.
Monica: No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
Joey: That's ridiculous!
Ross: Can I use...either thumb?
Chandler: I'd rather go with the foot theory.
Rachel: Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!
Rachel: Decaf cappuccino for Joey...Coffee black...Latte...And an iced tea.
Rachel: I'm getting pretty good at this!
All: Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Rachel: Good for me!
Joey: You okay, Phoebe?
Phoebe: Yeah… no… I'm just…it's, I haven't worked… It's my bank.
Monica: What did they do to you?
Phoebe: It's nothing, it's just… Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT.
Ross: Easy.
Phoebe: And there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Chandler: Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
Phoebe: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with t hem.
Joey: What are you talking about? Keep it!
Phoebe: It's not mine. I didn't earn it. If I kept it, it would be like stealing.
Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
Phoebe: Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? “Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.”
Phoebe: Even if I was happy and skipping, I'd hear: “Not not mine. Not not mine.”
Monica: We're with you. We got it.
Phoebe: Okay. I'd just I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Rachel: Chandler, what are you doing?
Monica: Hey. What are you doing?
All: Oh! Oh, gross!
Ross: What is this? !
Chandler: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
Chandler: And this is my reward!
Ross: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit. No, you know what, forget about you, think about what we went through last time you quit.
Chandler: Okay, so this time I won't quit!
All: Ohhh! Put it out!
Chandler: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Phoebe: Oh, no! I...I can't drink this now!
Monica: Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
Rachel: This Alan again? How's it going?
Monica: It's going pretty good, you know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
Joey: So when do we get to meet the guy?
Ross: Yeah.
Monica: Let's see, today's Monday...Never.
All: Oh, come on! Come on!
Monica: No. No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Chandler: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy! ..
Chandler: Sorry.
Monica: Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Rachel: Well, then can we meet him?
Monica: Nope. Schhorry.
Ross: Joey, Joey, let it go.
Monica: Why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him.
Monica: They're like coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Paula: Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.
Paula: Come on, Mon, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
Monica: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Paula: Well, you do realize the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.
Monica: I know. I know. Mind if I whimper a little bit?
Paula: Whimper.
Monica: Okay, I'm done.
Joey: Let it go, Ross.
Ross: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Monica: Do you all promise?
All: Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Monica: Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Joey: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Ross: Hey, Pheebs.
Phoebe: “Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this football phone...as our free gift.” Do you believe this? ! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
Rachel: What bank is this?
Monica: Hey. It's him. Who is it?
Alan: It's Alan.
Joey: Chandler! He's here!
Monica: Do I look okay?
Ross: One more button.
-Monica: Okay.
Ross: Closed! How about closed?
Monica: I didn't know.
Ross: Yeah.
Monica: Please be good, Okay, Just remember how much you all like me.
Monica: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
Alan: Hi.
All: Hi, Alan.
Alan: I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
Monica: I'll call you tomorrow. Thank you. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin.
Monica: Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? Come on!
Ross:...I'll go.
Ross: Let's start with the way he kept picking at no, I'm sorry, I can't do this. We loved him.
All: We loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Monica: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
All: Yeah!
Rachel: That pimento trick!
Chandler: I'll never look at an olive the same way again.
Rachel: And did you notice...?
The Guys: Yeah.
Joey: You know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Phoebe: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
Ross: What shoe?
Phoebe: From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a...while...'
Ross: So I think Alan...will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
Rachel: What future boyfriends? No no, I th I think this could be, you know, it.
Monica: Really?
Chandler: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselholf of impression alone.
Chandler:You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
Ross: You know what I like most about him, though?
All: What?
Ross: The way he makes me feel about myself.
Monica: Hi. how was the game?
Ross: Well...
All: We won! ! Thank you! Yes!
Monica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Joey: Alan.
Ross: He was unbelievable. He was like that, that, that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base Alan, second base Alan, third base...
Rachel: I mean, it it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Chandler: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.
Monica: Can I ask you guys a question? Do you ever think that Alan is maybe. . sometimes...
Ross: What?
Monica:...I don't know, a little too Alan?
Rachel: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Ross: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alanness that, that, that we adore.
Chandler: I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Phoebe: Hey, Lizzie.
Lizzie: Hey, Weird Girl.
Phoebe: I brought you alphabet soup.
Lizzie: Did you pick out the vowels?
Phoebe: Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, you know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.
Lizzie: Saltines?
Phoebe: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Lizzie: What? Oh, my God! Oh my God, there's really money in here.
Phoebe: I know.
Lizzie: Weird Girl, what are you doing?
Phoebe: No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
Lizzie: No, no, I ha…I have to give you something.
Phoebe: No, that's fine, you don't...
Lizzie: You want my tin foil hat?
Phoebe: No. 'Cause you need that.
Phoebe: No, it's okay, thanks.
Lizzie: Please, let me do something.
Phoebe: Okay, alright, I'll tell you what. you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
Lizzie: Okay?
Phoebe: Okay.
Lizzie: Keep the change.
Phoebe: Thanks, Lizzie.
Lizzie: Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
Phoebe: No, I'm fine. Thanks.
Lizzie: See ya.
Ross: A thumb? !
All: Eww!
Phoebe: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker!
Chandler: Well, maybe it's a contest, you know? Like, collect all five?
Phoebe: Does, um, anyone wanna see?
All: No! Thanks.
All: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
Rachel: It's worse than the thumb!
Chandler: Hey, this is so unfair!
Monica: Oh, why is it unfair?
Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal!
Chandler: Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
Chandler: And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word.
Chandler: And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing?
Chandler: I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Joey: Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Rachel: Well, I,I could live without it.
Joey: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Ross: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Joey: Oh, "you do, do you"?
Ross: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Rachel: "Indeed there isn't"...
Rachel: I should really get back to work.
Phoebe: Yeah, because otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
All: Well. Oh...
Rachel: Ohh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come off.
Monica: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Paula: No.
Monica: Okay. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Paula: Wait wait. . we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Monica: Can you believe it? You know what? I just don't feel the thing.
Monica: I mean, they feel the thing. I don't feel the thing.
Paula: Honey. . you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
Monica: I know. it's gonna be really hard.
Paula: Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
Monica: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Joey: Do you have any respect for your body?
Ross: Don't you realize what you're, you're doing to yourself?
Chandler: Hey, you know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.
Chandler: The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Rachel: Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Chandler: Really? He does? Hey, buddy! What's up? Oh, she told you about that, huh?
Chandler: Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big. Well, that's true.
Chandler: Gee, you know, no one… no…one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!
Rachel: God, he's good.
Ross: If only he were a woman.
Rachel: Yeah.
Chandler: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock?
Chandler: If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Ross: Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Monica: Hey. Where's Joey?
Chandler: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
Rachel: I think he's across the hall.
Monica: Thanks.
Ross: There you go.
Chandler: Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Ross: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-tart? .. Pheebs?
Phoebe: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-tart?
Ross: Hey, I might!
Phoebe: I'm sorry. You know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
All: You're kidding. Oh my God.
Phoebe: And on my way over here I stepped in gum. What is up with the universe?
Joey: What's going on?
Monica: Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Joey: Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.
Rachel: Uh, Joey.
Joey: Oh, God!
Monica: Okay.
All: Oh!
Monica: Please, guys, we have to talk.
Phoebe: Wait, wait, I'm getting a déjà vu...no, I'm not.
Monica: Alright, we have to talk.
Phoebe: There it is!
Monica: Okay. It's,it's about Alan.
Rachel: Oh, speak of which, tell him we are on for the Renaissance Fair next weekend.
All: Oh...
Monica: Guys, before you get into that, there's something that you should know.
Monica: I mean, there's really no easy way to say this...I've decided to break up with Alan.
Ross: Is there somebody else?
Monica: No, nononono...it's just...you know, things change. People change.
Rachel: We didn't change. .
Joey: So that's it? It's over?
Joey: Just like that?
Phoebe: You know. . you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just… I…
Monica: Look, I, I could go on pretending.
Joey: Okay!
Monica: No, but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan. It wouldn't be fair to you!
Ross: Yeah, Well, who wants fair? I just want things back, you know, the way they were.
Monica: I'm sorry.
Chandler: Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
Rachel: I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up… I wanted him to meet my family.
Monica: I'll meet someone else. There'll be other Alans.
All: Oh, yeah! Right!
Monica: Are you guys gonna be okay?
Ross: Hey hey, we'll be fine.
Ross: We're just gonna need a little time.
Monica: I understand.
Alan: Wow.
Monica: I'm really sorry.
Alan: Yeah, I'm sorry too.
Alan: But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
Monica: Relieved?
Alan: Yeah, I mean, I had a great time with you. I just can't stand your friends.
Rachel: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?
Rachel: That was fun.
Ross: Yeah. He could row like a Viking.
Ross: So how'd it go?
Monica: Oh, you know.
Phoebe: Did he mention us?
Monica: He says he's really gonna miss you guys.
Ross: You had a rough day, huh...
Monica: You have no idea.
Ross: Come here.
Chandler:...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
All: No no no!
Chandler: I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak!
Chandler: I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
Phoebe: If you never smoke again , I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Chandler: Yeah, alright.
